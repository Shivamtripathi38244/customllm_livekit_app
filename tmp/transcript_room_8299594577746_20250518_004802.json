Mehul thrives in roles where he can lead or manage, so present a clear vision and highlight how he can take ownership of specific aspects. He values efficient collaboration but prefers structured responsibilities, so ensure tasks are well-defined. While approachable and warm, Mehul isn\u2019t overly personal, so keep discussions professional and focused on the project\u2019s impact. He balances teamwork with a need for independent focus, so demonstrate how the app's development can align with his skills both collaboratively and individually."

Madhur, though chill, is highly involved in group dynamics and network-building, showing a strong drive for impactful projects. If the application task requires teamwork and idea-sharing, Madhur may shine. However, for tasks demanding strict independence and precision, Mehul\u2019s determined mindset could be more effective. Think about the task\u2019s collaboration needs to decide. Both offer valuable strengths in different areas."
