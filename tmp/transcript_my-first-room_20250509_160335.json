Under stress, he may withdraw, micromanage, or fixate on unimportant details. Support Madhur with opportunities for creativity, affirmation of his impact, and simplifying overwhelming tasks. Effective communication with Madhur involves trust, long-term vision alignment, and clear feedback while respecting his values and need for privacy."

Offer flexibility in timing so it feels unpressured, and present the invitation sincerely, emphasizing mutual enjoyment. Keep the conversation empathetic and open."
